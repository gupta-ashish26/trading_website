Rules to Push to the repo:
One must create a branch and keep experimenting on that branch. Pull the repo to the desired branch and only then experiment with it.
At no time one can directly push the changes to the 'main' branch. Once you are confident that a major chunk has been completed and the code is in fully working condition only then push the changes to main.
Just for reference, any branch from remote repo can be pulled to any any branch on one's local repo.
Commit messages should be clear and crisp. (Follow present tense convention). (for 'main' branch)
Commit messages not necessary while you are experimenting with your own branch but recommended. No commit in main branch should have an unclear commit message.
