<h2>Rules to Push to the Repo:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One must create a branch and keep experimenting on that branch. Pull the repo to the desired branch and only then experiment with it.</li>
  <li>At no time can one directly push the changes to the <code>main</code> branch. Once you are confident that a major chunk has been completed and the code is in fully working condition only then push the changes to <code>main</code>.</li>
  <li>Just for reference, any branch from the remote repo can be pulled to any branch on one's local repo.</li>
  <li>Commit messages should be clear and crisp. (Follow present tense convention). (for <code>main</code> branch)</li>
  <li>Commit messages are not necessary while you are experimenting with your own branch but recommended. No commit in <code>main</code> branch should have an unclear commit message.</li>
</ul>
